A dark and twisted land, where ashen forests, jagged cliffs, and towering obsidian fortresses cast eerie shadows over the landscape. The air is thick with mist and the scent of burnt earth, as if the land itself remembers the destruction it has endured. The capital, Ironhold, looms over the wasteland, its black iron walls and towering spires a testament to strength and power. Pools of glowing red liquid bubble in the cracked ground, while ancient tombs lie forgotten beneath layers of dust and decay.

The Blightlands are a harsh and unforgiving place, where the trees are twisted and blackened, their branches stretching like claws toward the sky. Thick fog rolls over jagged mountains, hiding ruined temples and crumbling fortresses where dark forces once ruled. The ground is cracked and lifeless, with veins of red lava snaking through deep chasms. In the distance, the massive fortress of Ironhold rises like a jagged fang, its walls built from obsidian and reinforced with iron spikes. The air smells of burning embers, and distant howls echo through the desolate valleys.
