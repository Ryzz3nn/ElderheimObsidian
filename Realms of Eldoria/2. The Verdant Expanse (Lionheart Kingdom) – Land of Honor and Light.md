A beautiful and peaceful land, filled with rolling green hills, endless wheat fields, and deep, ancient forests. White-stone castles and fortified towns stand proudly, their banners waving in the wind. The grand city of Solhaven, built of marble and gold, sits at the center of this kingdom, its tall spires visible from miles away. To the east, a mountain range known as the Celestine Peaks reaches into the sky, their snow-capped peaks hiding forgotten temples and hidden monasteries. 

The Verdant Expanse is a realm of beauty and tranquility, where rivers glisten under the sun and forests hum with the songs of birds and whispering leaves. The land is alive, with deer grazing in the open fields and farmers tending to golden crops. Grand castles rise over the horizon, their tall towers shining in the sunlight, while villages rest safely within their protective walls. The air carries the fresh scent of wildflowers and pine, and magic flows through the roots of the ancient trees.
